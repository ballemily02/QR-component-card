## My process
My process to complete the challenge was to first look at the figma file for each of the elements, then split up the design into divs in HTML, before attempting to style each in CSS.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project I learnt how to be more confident in writing CSS and using divs to separate work in HTML.

I also found that by the end of the challenge I could use flexbox in CSS a lot more easily due to the practice.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - I found this website the best to help with any small HTML and CSS challenges as it gave the most clear instructions and was easy to use to fix any challenges.
